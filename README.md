# event_management_api
The final capstone project of my Backend Web Development program

#  Project Overview
The objective of this project was to design and implement an Event Management API using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). This API allows users to manage events by creating, updating, deleting, and viewing upcoming events. It interacts with a MySQL database to store event information and manage users, simulating a real-world scenario in event management platforms.
